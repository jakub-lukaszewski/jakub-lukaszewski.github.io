Hi, I am Jakub Lukaszewski (you can call me Kuba). I currently work on backend technologies at [VML](https://www.vml.com).

I consider myself as a hybrid between a software engineer specifically into the backend technology and accelerated computing (i.e. HPC, machine learning), and a business-oriented person deeply caring about many non-tech related aspects (e.g. product development, product-market fit, team building, leadership) in technology sector in general.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Systems Engineering with a Minor in Data Engineering at [Wroclaw University of Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrocław_University_of_Science_and_Technology).

In the past, I played football for 8 years. I played at [State Football Team](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kujawsko-Pomorski_Związek_Piłki_Nożnej) for 4 years and lead it as a Team Captain for 2 years while playing at [Zawisza Bydgoszcz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zawisza_Bydgoszcz). I was called up for a consultation by the [Polish Football Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Football_Association) for the main [Poland National Football Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland_national_football_team).
